        <h2>What happened?</h2>
        <p>On Wednesday, March 26th, Panda suffered a digestive arrest and was admitted to the <a
                href="https://clinicanido.es/" target="_blank"><strong>NIDO</strong> veterinary clinic</a>, in Valencia.
            After spending three days in intensive care, she passed away on Saturday the 29th.</p>
        <p>The autopsy revealed a condition compatible with <strong>VHD/RHD (viral hemorrhagic disease)</strong>.
            Initially, it was believed to be the cause (I made it public in <a
                    href="https://x.com/Montyclt/status/1906341497378635859" target="_blank">this post</a>), but the PCR
            test was negative for both types. In the end, the exact cause of her death could not be determined with
            certainty. I have attached the <a href="../statics/informe-veterinario.pdf">veterinary case report</a>.</p>

        <h2>Raffle Details</h2>

        <h3>The Prize</h3>
        <p>I'm raffling a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B52Y1YHS" target="_blank"><strong>PLOOHT pet water
            fountain</strong></a>, valued at approximately 45 euros. I chose this model because it was the one Panda
            used to drink water, and I wanted something that could be useful for any type of pet, encouraging more
            people to participate.</p>

        <h3>Goal and Use of Funds</h3>
        <p>The total cost of Panda's hospitalization was <strong>589.56 euros</strong>. Additionally, there were extra
            expenses such as cremation, transportation, and preventive tests for my other pets. This raffle aims to help
            recover most of this expense.</p>
        <p>If more than <strong>550 euros</strong> are raised, all the excess will be donated entirely to the <a
                href="https://www.instagram.com/refugio_minipow/" target="_blank"><strong>MINIPOW rabbit
            shelter</strong></a> in Valencia, Spain.</p>

        <h3>Participation and Prize Delivery Conditions</h3>
        <p><strong>The raffle is international</strong>. Anyone with a valid PayPal account can participate.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>If you win, and you're in Spain:</strong> You can choose between receiving the water fountain
                directly from Amazon or receiving <strong>45 euros via PayPal</strong>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>If you win, and you're outside Spain:</strong> The prize will be <strong>45 euros via PayPal
                transfer</strong>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Winner Announcement</h3>
        <p>The winner will be announced <strong>on January 1, 2026</strong>, on my <a
                href="https://twitter.com/montyclt" target="_blank"><strong>Twitter/X account (@montyclt)</strong></a>
            and also on the <a href="https://instagram.com/pelusa.panda" target="_blank"><strong>Instagram account
                (@pelusa.panda)</strong></a>.</p>

        <h2>Why Now?</h2>
        <p>Although several months have passed, I'm organizing this raffle now because I needed time to be able to
            organize it with a clearer mind.</p>
