            <li><strong>Name or nickname:</strong> It doesn't have to be real. I'll use it when announcing the winner and will make public the name entered (e.g., "The raffle was won by Filemon Pi"). It's recommended to use a unique name or nickname to avoid confusion. It will only be made public if you win.</li>
            <li><strong>Email address:</strong> I will only use it to confirm your participation and to communicate with the winner. It will never be made public.</li>
            <li><strong>Twitter and Instagram accounts:</strong> They are optional. If the winner has provided them, I will mention them when announcing the winner.</li>
            <li>Once the raffle is over, the database with the entries will be permanently deleted.</li>
